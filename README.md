## About this project

This project is a simple version of the linux shell made for the ALX **Simple Shell - Linux and Unix system programming** Project.                                                                                                                                                        
It is created using the **C programming Language** with multiple functionalities.

## Usage
                                                                                                               
> **Step 1:** Clone our repository using this command, (you need to have git installed on your machine first)

> **Step 2:** Navigate into the simple_shell directory:

> **Step 3:** Compile the C files in this way:

> **Step 4:** Run the shell                                                                                                                                     
````

**Exiting the shell**                                                                                                                                           
When you want to exit the shell, you can use one of the following methods:
